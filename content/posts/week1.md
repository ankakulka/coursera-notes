# Descriptive statistics for exploring data

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the basics of descriptive statistics and its tools
- Getting familiar with important principles for visualizing information
- Ability to apply knowledge and understand descriptive statistics of real data



You can summarize data in two ways:
1. Using nummerical summaries.
2. Using pictures.

Vizualising data is preferable not just because most people rather look at pictures than at numbers, but it can
also reveal trends that are not obvious instantanously, especially when looking at a large data set.
Choosing how to visualize data depends on the type of data and the goal of the visualization. 

### Types of data

**Quantitative** variables are  numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense.
These can be:
1. **Continuous**: could take on any possible value within an interval, many possible values.
    For example: height, weight, time
2. **Discrete**: countable value, finite number of values
    For example: a number of children in a household

**Qualitative** (Categorical) variables classify individuals or items into different groups. 
1. **Ordinal**: groups that have an order or ranking
    For example: student ranking
2. **Nominal** : doesn't have any associates ranking with ranking with it.
    For example: marital status

### Pie Chart, Bar Graph, and Histograms

- **Qualitative data**: pie chart or dot plot 
    - Comparison is easier on the dot plot
    - Pie chart is better at showing the percentage of the total that the category represents
- **Quantitative**(numbers): bar chart and histogram
    - Bar chart: pnly the height of the bars is meaningful
    - Histogram: allows to use bars with different widths representing frequency distribution


### Box Plot and Scatter Plot

Box plot - also called Box-and-Whisker Plot


### Providing Context is Key for Statistical Analyses

The purpose of a statistical analysis is typically to compare the observed data to some kind of reference. Therefore, it's very useful to provide context in graphical displays. There's a nice explanation of this in the book 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information' by Edward Tufte.

### Pitfalls when Visualizing Information

- Avoid flashy graphics
- Generally 3D graphics are making it harder to read the information
- 

## Nummerical Summary Measures



### Mean and Median

### Percentile, the Five Number Summary and Standard Deviation
